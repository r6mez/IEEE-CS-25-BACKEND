# Web Research

## How the Web Works

The web works as a system of interconnected documents and resources, which are accessed using the internet. When you enter a URL in a web browser, it sends a request to a web server, which then responds with the requested web page. The main components that enable this process include:

- **Web Browsers**: Software like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge that allow users to access websites.
- **Servers**: Computers that store and deliver web pages.
- **Protocols**: Rules like HTTP and HTTPS that govern data exchange.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Translates domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.

## HTTP vs HTTPS

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) are protocols used for communication between web browsers and servers.

- **HTTP**: The standard protocol for transferring web pages but lacks security.
- **HTTPS**: A secure version of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data.

HTTPS is preferred because it prevents data interception and ensures secure communication, which is especially important for sites handling sensitive information like banking and e-commerce.

## Web Servers

A web server is software and hardware that stores, processes, and delivers web pages to users. Popular web servers include:

- **Apache**: Open-source and widely used.
- **Nginx**: Known for high performance and scalability.
- **Microsoft IIS**: A proprietary web server by Microsoft.

Web servers process client requests using protocols like HTTP and HTTPS, handling static and dynamic content.

## DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS is like the phonebook of the internet, translating human-friendly domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 142.250.190.14). The key components of DNS include:

- **Root Servers**: The starting point for DNS queries.
- **Top-Level Domains (TLDs)**: Like .com, .org, .net.
- **Name Servers**: Manage specific domain records.

When you type a domain in your browser, DNS resolves it to an IP address so your device can connect to the correct server.
